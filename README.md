Bootstrap Team Assignment

    Team Project

In this project, build a copy of one of the following websites:

    Tech Talent South - techtalentsouth.com
    Tiny Horse - tinyhorse.com
    CO - eatatco.com  

You should recreate any buttons, navigation, images, forms, etc. that exist on your chosen website, but they do not need to function (ex: a form does not need to actually submit any information, links don't need to go to another page, etc.). 

While we will mainly be focusing on the desktop view of your site, extra consideration will be given to sites that function and look accurate on mobile as well. -- Each person is responsible for one link on each page. Home / Contact Me / Courses / Etc. 

All files (HTML, CSS, images, fonts, etc) should be uploaded to a GitHub repo on your profile. Use GitHub collaboration tools to work on one group repository. 

SUBMIT: 

1. Submit the link to your group repository on github

2. Submit screenshots of each of the pages on your site. 
    If only one person in the group, do a single page.
